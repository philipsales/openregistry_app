          This project aims to establish a human phenome-biobanking system on cancer. Once this biobanking system proves to be successful, Philippine General Hospital (PGH) can maintain the project and expand to collect other types of cancers, as well as other pathologies.
          <br/> <br/>
          Part of the project is to create a system that will facilitate long term storage of patient information, as well as easy access of medical professionals and researchers to relevant patient information without compromising patient confidentiality. As part of the extensive cancer phenome-biobanking system, the project will setup two new extensions: (a) the human cell repository system and (b) the biomonitoring program.
          <br/> <br/>
          The phenome-biobanking system will complement Philippine government-funded projects on health by providing access to relevant patient information, human tissue samples, human cell culture materials, and data on threatening levels of endocrine disruptors in Filipinos. The biobanking system aims to build an infrastructure that will serve as a model for collecting patient information and human specimens in the Philippines.

          The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Biobank, based at the University of the Philippines- Manila, 
          was established in January 2018 as a unique, investigator-driven initiative to understand the 
          genetic and molecular characteristics of cancer among Filipinos. The government-based biobank 
          collects patient-derived tumor specimens, peripheral blood specimens, hair and urine for long-term 
          storage and application into various biomedical or clinical research pursuits. PGH biobank's new 
          facility envisions that the collected tumor specimens from Filipino cancer patients can extend beyond 
          the institute and can support nationwide studies and even globally, as means for representation of the 
          Filipinos. Moreover, the investigator-driven study supporting the newly established biobank further aims 
          to explore the environmental exposure factors including endocrine-disrupting chemicals and ethnogeographical 
          biodiversity in a groundbreaking attempt to find a cure for cancer for Filipinos. The project is seen to expand 
          all over the country to obtain high quality biospecimens, specifically breast cancer, in the future. As of the moment, 
          the biobank has established collaborations with the University of California in San Francisco and the 
          University of the Philippines- Diliman, and continues to be open for potential collaborators
